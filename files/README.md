# Files relating to the tutorial
This folder contains some files referenced within the original tutorial.
I was unable to retrieve the files from the original websites/WayBack archive. But I was
able to find, what I'm assuming, to be the files used.

Originally uploaded to Github repo: [James-Molloy-OS](https://github.com/dhyey35/james-molloy-os/), by user [dhyey35](https://github.com/dhyey35)

Any original files I am able to find I will upload as their original name, and will then still include the found files with the 'alt_' prefix.

> [!WARNING]
> I have not personally checked any of the files used here, I have only
> reuploaded them under assumption that they are the reference files. Use at your own
> risk.
