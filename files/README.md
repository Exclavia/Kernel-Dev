# Files relating to the tutorial
This folder contains some files referenced within the original tutorial.
I was unable to retrieve some of the files from the original websites/WayBack archive. But I was
able to find, what I'm assuming, to be the files used.

Originally uploaded to Github repo: [James-Molloy-OS](https://github.com/dhyey35/james-molloy-os/), by user [dhyey35](https://github.com/dhyey35)

Any original files/files that only have a reuploaded version I will upload as their original name within the current directory. Any alternative versions I will put into the [Alt folder](https://github.com/Exclavia/Kernel-Dev/tree/main/files/alt).

> [!WARNING]
> I have not personally checked any of the files used here, I have only
> reuploaded them. Use at your own
